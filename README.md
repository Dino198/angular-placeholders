# Placeholders for AngularJS!

---

## Placeholder Text

angular-placeholders includes a `placeholderText` directive for the insertion of
"Lorem ipsum"-style text. It can work as either an element or an attribute and
accepts two optional attributes: `num-sentences` and `num-paragraphs`. If
`num-sentences` is provided, the body of the element will be replaced with the
specified number of sentences. `num-paragraphs` will replace the body of the
element with the specified number of `<p>` tags containing random sentences. 

The default behavior is a random number of paragraphs.

## Building

The build toolchain for angular-placeholders was ~~stolen~~ borrowed from the
[ui-bootstrap](http://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap) project.
